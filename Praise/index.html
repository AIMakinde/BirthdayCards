        <p>What a wonderful birthday and joyful milestone — double digits at last!</p>
        <p>This year, you have already been so brave and adventurous, moving to America. I’m so proud of you for taking that big step with such a bright smile.</p>
        <p>You and your little sister are my best friends — those third-Sunday all-day visits are the highlight of my months. I love our playtime and those hilarious little prayers you make before every meal. Thank you for filling our house with laughter — and not stinky-smelling farts.</p>
        <p>May God bless you richly in this new year of your life. Praise, you remind me of Samuel, who was dedicated to the Lord by his parents and called by God while still a child (1 Sam. 1:27–28; 3:10). May you listen, serve, and shine for God as you grow. Like young Josiah (2 Chron. 34:1–3), may you continue to seek the Lord with a brave and joyful heart. I pray Paul’s words to Timothy for you: let no one despise your youth (1 Tim. 4:12). May our good God continue to surround you with true friends, keep you safe, grow your faith, and fill your days with wonder and joy.</p>
        <blockquote>“The Lord bless you and keep you; The Lord make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you.” — Numbers 6:24–25</blockquote>
        <p>Enjoy every slice of cake, every hug, and every hilarious prayer today. I love you so much.</p>
        <p class="signature">Love from Jeremiah, my wife, and me — with birthday blessings and big hugs. ❤️🙏</p>
