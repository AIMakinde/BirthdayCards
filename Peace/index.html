        <p>Happy belated birthday to my very best friend — the real VIP of the family!</p>

        <p>
          Peace, you have a very special place in my heart. You are the one who chose me first — 
          the little girl who decided that visiting me every second Sunday was non-negotiable.
          Those days became our tradition, and honestly, they were some of my happiest moments.
        </p>

        <p>
          You always cling to me like a tiny koala, and I secretly hope you never stop.
          Whether we were playing, laughing, or just sitting together, you brought joy
          so effortlessly. Cape Town feels quieter without your footsteps, your voice,
          and your very serious presence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Watching you move was both brave and beautiful. Even when big changes
          happen, you carry peace — just like your name — into every place you go.
          I am so proud of you.
        </p>

        <p>
          I pray that you grow strong, kind, and joyful, always knowing how deeply you are loved.
          May you grow like Jesus did — in wisdom, stature, and favour with God and people
          (Luke 2:52). May your heart always be gentle, your faith steady, and your laughter loud.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          “The Lord will give strength to His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace.” — Psalm 29:11
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Enjoy your cake (even the crumbs), the hugs, the laughs, and all the love surrounding you —
          even from very far away.
        </p>

        <p class="signature">
          Love from Jeremiah, my wife, and me — with big hugs, missed Sundays, and endless prayers. ❤️🙏
